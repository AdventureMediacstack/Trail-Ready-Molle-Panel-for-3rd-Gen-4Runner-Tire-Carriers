                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Product Information</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Our 3rd Gen Molle Panel is built to mount seamlessly to swing-out style tire carriers and bumpers, offering a secure and modular platform for all your off-road essentials. Made from durable steel with a clean black powder coat finish, it delivers the rugged strength you need for serious adventures while looking sharp on any 3rd Gen build.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>This Molle panel is compatible with most standard Molle accessories, including recovery gear, fuel cans, water containers, axes, shovels, and even storage pouches. It’s a perfect match for those who demand functionality without compromising aesthetics.</span></p>
                <h2 dir="ltr"><span>Maximize Your Rear Carrier</span></h2>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>We designed this Molle panel to solve one of the most common pain points among off-roaders: limited cargo access and organization on the swing-out arm. Many tire carrier setups lack usable storage real estate and that’s wasted potential.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>Our Molle panel maximizes that space by offering a customizable solution that keeps your essential gear within easy reach. Unlike bulky alternatives, this panel keeps your setup clean and low-profile while still being tough enough to hold your heaviest tools.</span></p>
                <p dir="ltr"><span>When you're off-grid and need quick access to your recovery gear, this mount delivers no digging, no hassle. It’s not just a mod; it’s a smart upgrade for any serious 4Runner owner.</span></p>
